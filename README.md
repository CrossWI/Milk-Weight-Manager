CS400 final A-Team project. Takes in milk weight data and displays to a interactive GUI

Ateam Group Number: 24

Team Members: Collin Krause(Lecture 001, cpkrause2@wisc.edu, xTeam 184), Richard Wang (Lecture 001, rwang473@wisc.edu, xTeam 184), Cameron Cross (Lecture 001, cacross3@wisc.edu, xTeam 113), Ryan DeMar (Lecture 001, rdemar@wisc.edu, xTeam 190). Collin and Richard were in the same xTeam.

Project description: This program will be used by local farmers in order to help them track and analyze the milk that was sold to them. The program will be able to read in data about milk weights from different files and display the data in an interactive graphic user interface. The data will be dependent on a farm ID. The GUI will display statistics about individual farms for any given month. 

Bug Report: 
No known bugs



Future Work Section:
-More exception handling
-Display the data more clearly in a chart, rather than just in a list as it is currently
